# ListGroupingControl
This (grouping of items in a list)program was originally built for a position at a programming firm and failed.
In the public sphere it may have better uses.
Thank you to all the people encouraged me to produce this code, particularly the unmentioned firm.
In getting me to write this code, my understanding of life has changed for the better.
